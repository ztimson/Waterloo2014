Here are my competition programs, I completed 3/5 (+an unworking program that I didnt have time for (#4))
All my programs are unmodified sense I originaly codded them so you can see my raw coding skill well working fast and underpressure. The only
things I added was the comment to walk you through my thought prosses

Summary of rules:
 - Only writen resorces are allowed to be brought in and used
 - Every file must use file input and standard output (Names correspond (S1.java < S1.txt))
 - 3 hours to complete as many as possible + only completed programs count
 - some programs may be rated on efficency

Notes:
 - I doubled the second place person's score in the local area.

UPDATE:
 - My first two programs recieved full marks and completed every test
 - My third failed misserably and because I needed a minimum of 40 points (15 points a question)
   I could not move on to participate at waterloo
