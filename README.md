# Waterloo 2014
In 2014, while I was in grade 12, I competed in Waterloo's senior programing cometition.

These promgrams correspond to the problems found inside [Waterloo-2014.pdf](./Waterloo-2014.pdf).

## Table of Contents
[[_TOC_]]

## Rules:
 - 3 hours to complete as many problems as possible; only completed programs count
 - Only writen resorces are allowed to be brought in and used (No internet/search engine)
 - Every file must use file input and standard output (Names correspond (S1.java < S1.txt))
 - Some programs are rated on efficency

## Results
 - 1st place in local area, doubling 2nd place's score
 - S1 completed every test & recieved full marks (40 points)
 - S2 completed every test & recieved full marks (40 points)
 - S3 only halfed worked (15 points), I rushed to move onto S4
 - S4 didn't have time to complete

In hindsight, knowing I only needed to pass 3 problems to advance to nationals, I should have focused on the 3 easiest problems & ensured they all worked instead of rushing through all of the problems & ending up with two half-complete.
